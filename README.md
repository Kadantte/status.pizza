## How do I use it?

### Standard

To request a captioned status code image, simply format the request as shown below:

`https://status.pizza/[CODE]`

You can optionally specify a PNG file extension:

`https://status.pizza/[CODE].png`

### JSON

To receive a JSON object containing status code metadata and URLs for both the captioned and raw images, add a JSON file extension:

`https://status.pizza/[CODE].json`

The object you receive will have the following format:

```
{
	"code": "[CODE]",
	"title": "[CODE_TITLE]",
	"image": "https://status.pizza/[CODE]",
	"raw": "https://status.pizza/img/[CODE].png",
	"category": "[CODE_CATEGORY]"
}
```

That\'s it; you are now a certified Status Pizza expert!
